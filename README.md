# Experiment 2: Study and Implementation of Data Types & Storage Classes

## Aim
To:
- Understand and use data types in C++  
- Explore storage classes – auto, static, extern, register  
- Learn about variable scope and how many bytes are allocated to each data type  

---

## Objectives
- Apply different storage classes  
- Understand the storage, scope, and default values of each class  
- Learn how to check memory size using sizeof operator  

---

## Program Overview
- A user-defined function demonstrates the behavior of variables under different storage classes.  
- The `main()` function calls that user-defined function.  
- The `sizeof` operator is used to determine memory usage by each data type.  

---

## What I Used
- **Storage Classes:** auto, extern, static, register  
- **Data Types:** int, float, char, bool, short, long, double  
- **Operator:** sizeof

## Theory: Data Types in C++

In C++, data types define the type and size of data that a variable can store. They are essential for memory allocation and data manipulation.  

### Basic Data Types
- **int** – Stores integers (e.g., 1, 100, -35)  
- **float** – Stores floating-point numbers with decimals (e.g., 3.14, -0.55)  
- **double** – Double-precision floating-point numbers, more accurate than float  
- **char** – Stores single characters (e.g., 'A', 'z')  
- **bool** – Stores boolean values: true (1) or false (0
